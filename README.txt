depending on a number of values.

== Description ==

JIMMO WP Loan Repayment Calculator lets you add a multi-page form to your site where your visitors can 
calculate a payment plan for their annuity loan.

**Look at a [demo and in-depth description](http://www.net-jet.de/jimmo-wp-loan-repayment-calculator/) of the plugin!**

The form is responsive and adapts to the place where it is included (e.g. Content, Sidebar, ...), as well as
the screen size, as long as the theme itself is responsive, too.

The following Values are taken into account:

* Loan amount
* Annual percentage rate
* One of initial repayment rate, monthly payment or period in years
